# Gopher Net

This is a project to flex and polish my Go programming skills. at this point I am not 100% sure what the final product will be. But I do know that I
want to make a web server with microservices. It will probably be the server for a new version of my website/portfolio. I might host games on it my main
to concerns I am trying to balance are the cost for hosting and providing a unique/cool feature(s)

## Possible Features

- Blog/Forum something with user accounts and fostering a community
- Game marketplace, mine and possibly others
- A website aggregator based on topics (like StumbleUpon)
- Interactive demos/games, blog, free learning resources
